Quartus host project
====================
This folder contains a simple "basic" board computer with the A-Z80,
some RAM and UART and it can run selected Z80 executable files.

./tools/zmac contains a few of the Z80 sample programs to run and
batch scripts to assemble and copy them into this directory.
