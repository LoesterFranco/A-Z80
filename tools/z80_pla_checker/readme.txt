z80_pla_checker
===============
Experiment with a Z80 PLA table! The content of the PLA table is published here:
http://arcfn.com/files/z80-pla-table.html
I have made some adjustments to it, to be used with the A-Z80 project.
A version of the PLA is in the ../resources along with other (instruction) tables.

Compile and run with Visual Studio 2010.
